Detecting cyber-attacks has become a critical priority in the quickly changing world of cyber security and big data analytics. With the exponential expansion of data and the sophistication of cyber-attacks, traditional protection techniques are becoming ineffective. To overcome the challenges in cyber security and big data analytics, we introduce a model called hybrid classification models with tuned weights that combine multiple algorithms to improve detection accuracy and mitigate cyber threats effectively. Algorithms used are LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and DMO (Deep Max Out).

Feature selection is critical for increasing the performance of machine learning models by finding the most important characteristics that contribute to the model's predictive capacity. We use ICA (Independent Component Analysis) for feature selection. To increase machine learning model performance and detection accuracy, optimize model parameters, tune weights, and use optimization techniques like Sea Gull Optimization (SE-SGO). By adopting these strategies and leveraging the collective expertise of the cybersecurity and data analytics communities, we can strengthen our defences, improve threat detection capabilities, and build resilient systems to protect critical information assets from evolving cyber threats.
